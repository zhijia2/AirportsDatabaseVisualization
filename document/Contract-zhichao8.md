# Team Contract

Communication

**Team Meetings:** Our team will meet once a week every Friday from 5-7 PM using Zoom. Each member will rotate being the designated note-taker, starting with Zhijia. Notes will be stored on a Google document, time-stamped for each meeting.

**Assistance:** Each team member can be contacted through email ({zhijia2, zhichao8, qic7}@illinois.edu). Outside of emergencies or other commitments, we commit to responding to emails within 48 hours.

**Respect:** The note-taker for the week will also serve as the &quot;project lead&quot; for the weekly meeting. Their role is to ensure that every member of the group has had a chance to speak or state their opinion about a design decision. However, design decisions can be accpted by simple majority - while unanimous agreement is preferred, it is not required. Each member of the team commits to adhering to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them.

Collaboration

**Work Distribution:**  Each week, the necessary deliverables for the week will be determined by the full team and each member will volunteer to work on one or more deliverables. When no one volunteers, two team members will be randomly assigned the task.

**Time Commitment:** Each member is expected to work no less than 2 and no more than 6 hours per week on the project. If a deliverable ends up taking more time, the rest of the team should be pulled in to assist with the unforeseen complication.

**Conflict Resolution:** Any disagreement shall be settled through a respectful manner and resolved in the weekly team meeting. Habitually and multiple time of failure to perform will lead to a termination of the contract after which the situation will be reported to the course staff.
