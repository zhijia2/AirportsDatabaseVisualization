# **Airports Database** **Visualization and Shortest Routes Finding (C++)**

## project description

In the final project, we used airports around the world and their distances to each other to construct a adjancent matrix to determine the shortest path from Airport A to Airport B. You could input the source and destination on the terminal(if you input wrong the function will not run) and it will output the shortested path from the source to destination and output.txt(includes all the airports bfs from the source). Then it will ask you if you want to see the output.png, you could reply yes if you wnat to see it

## Running the Project
using the following command to compile:
```
make final
./final
Input the source for example zyl
output the destination for example zvk
if you input the wrong name it will not run 
if you want to see the output.png you should input yes after the shortst path showing up
```
## Testing the Project
using the following command to compile:
```
make test
./test
```
